  a b c d
a 3 2 1 1
b 0 3 1 2
c 1 0 3 1
d 0 0 0 3

d(ab) = 4
d(da) = 1
d(db) = 4
d(dc) = 1
d(ac) = 2
d(bc) = 1

Process on each pass:
1.Calculate distance(squared euclidean) between each pair of cells
2.Sorted by the distance of each pair
3.Cluster the nearst pair together (if happens to be tie) only one pairing each pass
4.Calculate the centroid of every new cluster
5.Go back to 1. and repeat
6.Stop while A) Reach a preferrable amount of group, or B) Distances between cluster are larger than a threshold. C) Everything is grouped into one giant cluster.
